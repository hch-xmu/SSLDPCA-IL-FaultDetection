download the dataset at http://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/download-data-file and put the .mat file in this dir 

BE CAREFUL: the "99.mat" in the original dataset includes two 98.mat variables, so you should delete the X098_DE_time and X098_FE_time variables in 99.mat and re-save it manually.
